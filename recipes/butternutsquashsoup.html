    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This is a thick, rich butternut squash soup with tons of flavor. Something
      I whipped up off the top of my head, with things I had on hand. Super
      easy, quick, and a great way to use squash. An instant hit at my house.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>

      <li>
        Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat, and cook onion, celery,
        carrot, potatoes, and squash until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
        Pour in enough chicken stock to cover vegetables.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover pot,
        and simmer until all vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Transfer soup to a blender and process until smooth. Return to the pot
        and mix in any remaining stock to reach desired consistency. Season with
        salt and pepper.
